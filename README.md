## Question 30

**Domain:** Domain 3: How GitHub Copilot Works and Handles Data
**Type:** multiple-choice

A developer working in Visual Studio Code on a large JavaScript repo notices Copilot Chat now gives more accurate responses, especially for deeply nested code or older functions.

What would explain why Copilot understands more context than before?

- **A.** Copilot Chat is using a larger context window, enabling it to process more of the open file and surrounding repository when generating responses.
- **B.** Copilot has started learning from the developer's commit history and uses that history to influence future completions.
- **C.** Copilot has finished indexing the entire GitHub repository locally, allowing it to access all project files in real time.
- **D.** Copilot stores all previous chats and uses them to train the model on the fly for each new prompt.

**Correct answer(s):** A

<details>
<summary><strong>Show explanation</strong></summary>

A context window is the amount of code, text, and metadata that GitHub Copilot can "see" and use when generating a suggestion or response.

It defines how much information the underlying language model—such as GPT or Codex—can process at once. This includes:

- The surrounding lines of code (before and after your cursor)

- Comments and docstrings

- Open files in your IDE

- File names and project structure

- Natural language questions in Copilot Chat

The larger the context window, the more Copilot can consider at one time, which usually leads to more relevant and accurate suggestions—especially in large files or complex projects.
